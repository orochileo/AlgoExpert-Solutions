For better or worse, you will need five parts to prepare in your next SDE position.
1. Your resume
2. Solving coding questions
3. Object-oriented design
4. System Design
5. Behavioral Questions

Section 1 Resume
A resume should briefly summarize your past experience as a software engineer, the projects you worked on, the data of your work.
Make sure that the qualifications on your resume match the Job Description.

Section 2 Coding
For starters, I recommend Neetcode 150: https://neetcode.io/practice
If you have more time, take a look at Grind 169: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?hours=40&weeks=26
And of course, Leetcode premium is a must :)
I would recommend solving problems in tags to get a deeper understanding

Section 3 OOD
There are many good OOD tutorials, you can check this one out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJW65Wo7IHI&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvS5P7khyR4xDp7T9lCk9PgE

Section 4 System Design
I will recommend two textbooks for System Design Interview: 1. Educative.io, Grokking the System Design interview; 2. Alex Xu, System Design Interview Volume 1&2
Also, if you know Chinese, you can take a look at this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ScottShiCS/videos
If you are targeting for a senior-level role, I recommend reading DDIA

Section 5 BQ
STAR method is the ultimate key in solving BQ questions. Prepare common questions like "What was the toughest project you ever worked on?" "How to balance your life and work when there is a tight deadline?"
Also, it's always good to take a look at Amazon's Leadership Principles.
